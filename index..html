            <p>
              I am 29 years old and a huge goal of mine is to be employed as a full-stack develepor by the time I'm 30.
              I've mainy come from a laborer background, I spent 5 years as an associate at Walmart after a graduated
              high school. my first position there was a shipping associate. I then was promoted to shipping clerk
              within 1 year of employment. I worked as a Shipping Clerk for roughy 2 years before getting a promotion
              again as yard driver. As a yard driver I was trusted with hauling Walmart and non-Walmart trailers on
              property, pulling to and from dock bay doors.
            </p>

            <p>
              After 5 years of service with Walmart I decided to 'broaden my horizons' by attempting to join a union
              program as an electrical lineman. I failed in being accepted into the program and then became employed by
              East Coast Lumber in Hampstead, NH. I worked as a general laborer for 1 year before accepting a job with
              Communications Construction Group as a Groundhand. The duties as a Groundhand were to assist the
              construction foreman with various tasks thoughout the day to finish jobs. The main objective in a job is
              to run fiber or Co-axial cable, sometimes both, from a point on the telephone lines to the destination
              (customer's suite). After roughly 8 months of employment as a Groundhand I was promoted to the Warehouse
              Manager. In this job I was tasked with inventory of various materials needed to install fiber and Co-axial
              cable, as well as performing safety checks on the workforce out of the office I am employed. As of october
              1st, 2019, I was promoted to a Fiber Splicer. My primary objective is to splice the fibers onto the
              Comcast network resulting in Fiber Optic internet for the client.
